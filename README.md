# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in C

This repository is dedicated to the study and implementation of various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using the C programming language. Each folder within this repository focuses on a specific DSA topic.

## Topics Covered

- **DMA**: Contains dynamic memory allocation using C functions.
- **Hashing**: C implementations for various hashing techniques.
- **List**: Includes implementations of different types of lists in C, such as linked lists.
- **Queue**: Contains examples of queue operations including enqueue and dequeue, implemented in C.
- **Recursion**: Demonstrates the use of recursion in solving problems, with C function examples.
- **Searching**: Covers linear and binary search algorithms implemented in C.
- **Sorting**: Contains sorting algorithms like bubble sort, quick sort, and merge sort in C.
- **Stack**: Focuses on stack operations such as push, pop, and top, implemented in C.
